Using structs, arrays, and user created functions in C, I learnt how to call functions, organise my code and run a program that counts votes from user submission, and check for invalid votes if the user does not vote for a candidate that exists.

The limitation in this program is that the number of voters and candidates have to be predefined with a prompt to the user, using the CS50 function get_int, get_string, etc.
